<PRE>Hi

She wanted also to learn Latin, always. But never was able to do that. And 
we have emailed about Latin. Right for understanding more of our grammar. 
Latin uses word order not for free but to put stress and express tiny 
features in the language. In more languages we can do that.

I showed a kind of fixed order in English to her. The time adverbs.

Normal the sequence is the sequence: it was today, in the summer month 
June, in the year 2006. But also in English you tell a joke in the opposite 
way. First a global entrance and the precise clue at the end. So for some 
people in this world the word order is a little bit strange in English.

The New ERA could have broken out 13 May 2006 but a communication error 
from the other side was bad.

This is a Dutch story, my side:

I am very sorry for that language.

well oh well and we go on....
