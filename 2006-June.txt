Subject: [Nnw-language] Hi language lovers

How are you?

We promote form then NNW project also a new ERA.

I worked for it awake one party from our bad government. That was D66. In 
many emails I have talked about. Please spread our layers everywhere among 
your members. But something in the communication at their side has gone 
wrong. Otherwise the New Era had broken out May 13th 2006. But you have 
nothing heard about it. And now we are waiting for a next chance.

Languages at high schools will improve certainly in the new ERA.

And this is the latest news from me.


Later we are needing more translators also from Dutch to English. I ask 
continually for more members. And active members are becoming the 
cofounders of the new ERA.

Please have a nice time

Hi language lovers

We have a new active language lover who writes like me also short stories 
and poems.

And her native language is English so I will learn from her. She is already 
active.

A great woman.

Have a nice life,

ed

Hi

She wanted also to learn Latin, always. But never was able to do that. And 
we have emailed about Latin. Right for understanding more of our grammar. 
Latin uses word order not for free but to put stress and express tiny 
features in the language. In more languages we can do that.

I showed a kind of fixed order in English to her. The time adverbs.

Normal the sequence is the sequence: it was today, in the summer month 
June, in the year 2006. But also in English you tell a joke in the opposite 
way. First a global entrance and the precise clue at the end. So for some 
people in this world the word order is a little bit strange in English.

The New ERA could have broken out 13 May 2006 but a communication error 
from the other side was bad.

This is a Dutch story, my side:

I am very sorry for that language.

well oh well and we go on....

jippppiieee
