Hi

What do you think of this.

Languages of people at the sea. Moisty weather. We need to loose moist. 
Keep your mouth open for that. When it's not to called and we speak words 
in the front of our mouth. Please don't bite.

Is that true in general? What do you think?

And now we are in a desert. Hot the burning sun. Please shut your mouth and 
we have many sounds coming from our throat, guttural sounds. Is that true. 
What do you think?

Is the climate we are living in so important?

That is a language question.

Do you also like languages?

Please have a splendid day
